    ## System Architecture Exploration
    
    ### Current Foundation Analysis
    - **Eino Framework**: Go-based AI framework providing pipeline architecture and component composition
    - **Neo4j Graph Database**: Knowledge graph for storing personal context, relationships, and conversation history
    - **Vector Database**: Embedding-based storage for semantic search and memory retrieval
    - **Integration Challenge**: How to orchestrate these components into a cohesive 24/7 system
    
    ### Data Flow Possibilities
    - **Ingestion Layer**: Continuous monitoring of IM platforms (Lark, Slack) and web conversations
    - **Processing Layer**: Content filtering, context extraction, and memory consolidation
    - **Storage Layer**: Dual storage in graph database (structured) and vector database (semantic)
    - **Interaction Layer**: Proactive conversation triggers and responsive dialogue management
    
    ### Architecture Patterns to Consider
    - **Event-Driven Architecture**: React to external events and internal state changes
    - **Pipeline Architecture**: Use eino's pipeline system for data processing workflows
    - **Microservices Pattern**: Separate concerns into independent, testable components
    - **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read and write operations for optimal performance

    ## System Integration Logic
    
    ### Component Orchestration Strategy
    ```
    External Data Sources → Data Ingestion Service → Processing Pipeline → Storage Layer → Conversation Engine
    ```
    
    ### Memory Architecture Reasoning
    - **Short-term Memory**: Recent conversations and immediate context (in-memory cache)
    - **Medium-term Memory**: Daily/weekly patterns and preferences (Neo4j graph)
    - **Long-term Memory**: Semantic knowledge and historical patterns (vector database)
    - **Working Memory**: Current conversation context and active tasks (eino context)
    
    ### Proactive Conversation Logic
    - **Context Analysis**: Analyze recent conversations for emotional state and topics
    - **Timing Optimization**: Learn user's availability patterns and preferred interaction times
    - **Relevance Scoring**: Score potential conversation topics based on user interests and current context
    - **Trigger Conditions**: Define clear conditions for when to initiate conversations

    ## Critical System Challenges
    
    ### Performance and Scalability
    - How to maintain 24/7 operation without memory leaks or performance degradation?
    - How to handle large volumes of conversation data efficiently?
    - How to balance real-time processing with system resource constraints?
    
    ### Privacy and Security
    - How to ensure personal conversation data remains secure and private?
    - How to implement proper data encryption and access controls?
    - How to handle sensitive information in conversation logs?
    
    ### User Experience
    - How to make proactive conversations feel natural rather than intrusive?
    - How to maintain conversation context across different interaction modes (voice/text)?
    - How to handle interruptions and context switching gracefully?
    
    ### Technical Integration
    - How to ensure reliable integration with external APIs (IM platforms)?
    - How to handle API rate limits and service outages gracefully?
    - How to maintain data consistency across multiple storage systems?
  </challenge>
